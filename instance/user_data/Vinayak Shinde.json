    "wellness_report": "Hey there! Chikitsa here, your friendly mental health guide.  Wow, you've really opened up here, and that takes courage!  Let's take a look at your answers together, just like chatting over coffee, okay?  Think of me as your friend who also happens to know a bit about how our minds work.\n\nFirst off, awesome to hear you have a strong support system and you're not having thoughts of harming yourself or others \u2013 that's fantastic!  Seriously, having people around you who care and feeling safe in your own mind is super important.  And no nightmares or flashbacks? That's also a really good sign that you're not currently dealing with some heavy stuff from the past.  High five for that! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nNow, you mentioned \"yes\" to substance use.  Hmm, let's just put a gentle spotlight on that for a sec.  It's like, imagine your body and mind are a super cool car.  Substances can sometimes be like putting the wrong kind of fuel in that car, you know?  It might seem to give you a boost for a bit, but long-term, it can mess with the engine and the way everything runs.  No judgment at all, okay?  Just something to be mindful of and maybe think about if it's truly serving you well.  If you ever feel like chatting more about this, I'm all ears, like a really good friend who genuinely cares. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThen, you said \"no\" to expressing feelings openly.  It's like holding in a sneeze, isn't it?  It can feel a bit uncomfortable after a while.  Feelings are like little messengers; they tell us things.  Learning to let them out, even just to yourself at first, can be really freeing.  It's like decluttering your mental space!  No pressure though, we all have our own pace.\n\n\"Nothing to let go of in life?\"  Wow, you must be living a super zen life!  Just kidding! \ud83d\ude09  We all have *something*, even if it's just that pile of clothes in the corner of the room we've been meaning to deal with!  Maybe it's not a big heavy thing, but sometimes even small things we let go of can make us feel lighter.  Think about it, maybe there's just a tiny little pebble in your shoe that you haven't noticed yet.\n\nOkay, a pomegranate vegetable garden!  Haha, that's wonderfully creative!  Pomegranates are actually fruits, my friend, but hey, who says we can't have a fruit garden and call it a vegetable garden?  It's *your* garden!  And \"asdfghjk\" as your favorite condiment?  You're a funny one! \ud83d\ude02  Is that some super secret ingredient I haven't heard of yet?  Seriously though, it's good you have a sense of humor!  Laughter is like sunshine for the soul.\n\nYou see yourself as goal-oriented and maybe others see you as \"selfish.\"  It's cool to be driven, like a rocket aiming for the stars! \ud83d\ude80 But sometimes, we need to remember we're not alone in space.  Other people are part of our galaxy too.  Maybe it's not about being selfish or selfless, but about finding a balance, like a seesaw \u2013  taking care of yourself *and* being mindful of others.  And hey, loving your brain is awesome!  Your brain is your superpower!  Use it wisely and kindly, both for yourself and the world around you.\n\nAnd shopping if you win the lottery!  Who doesn't dream of a little shopping spree?  Treat yourself!  Dogs are the best, totally agree! \ud83d\udc36 Salty over sweet?  Team salty!  It's all about those savory flavors, right?\n\nSo, to sum it up, you seem like a strong, independent person with a good head on your shoulders (literally, you love your brain!).  You have a support system, which is amazing.  Just a gentle nudge to maybe explore the substance use a bit, and think about letting those feelings flow out more.  And hey, maybe plant some *fruit* trees in your vegetable garden! \ud83d\ude09\n\nRemember, Chikitsa is here for you, anytime you want to chat, share a joke, or just think things through.  You're doing great, keep being you! \ud83d\ude0a"
